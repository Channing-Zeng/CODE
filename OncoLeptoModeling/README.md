This repository contains the code to produce some of the figures in Vasconcellos et al (2014): ``**Infection with Leptomonas wallacei affects physiology and population dynamics of  Oncopeltus fasciatus: an insight into parasitism**.`` 

**Code availabilty**
Please feel free to do whatever you want with these scripts, but bear in mind they were written for a custom application and therefore may contain monstrous hacks just to make things work.
Please see https://raw.githubusercontent.com/phylogeography/DeepRoot/master/README.md for a suitable licence.

**Data availability**
Please note that the data in this repository are not public yet, and are there only to make possible the generation of the figures and analyses.
If you would like to use this data on your research, please contact Professor Angela Hampshire [angela.lopes(sorry_spybots)micro.ufrj.br].
